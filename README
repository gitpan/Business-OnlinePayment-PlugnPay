This is Business::OnlinePayment::PlugnPay, a Business::OnlinePayment
back end module for plugnpay. http://www.plugnplay.com/

Based on Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet written by Jason Kohles.
Currently maintained by Jeff Finucane <plugnpay@weasellips.com>.

Business::OnlinePayment is a generic interface for processing payments
through online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses,
etc.  (If you like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform
ecommerce-enabling middleware solution").

Check support is in "developer mode" because I have no test facilities.
A developer should easily be able to get check support functioning.
